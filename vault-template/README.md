# vault-template

Copy this folder as your starting Obsidian vault framework.

## structure

- `00-hub` — operating system docs, dashboards, rules
- `01-inbox` — incoming ideas/tasks to triage
- `02-research` — research that does not yet belong to a project
- `03-projects` — project-based execution
- `04-memory` — durable memory and decision logs

## naming rules

- lowercase only
- hyphen-separated names
- no spaces/camelCase

## project rule

Each project in `03-projects/` should have:
- `strategy/`
- `context/`
- `content/`

## quick start

1. Copy this `vault-template` directory to your desired vault location.
2. Open it as a vault in Obsidian.
3. Fill `00-hub/operating-rules.md` first.
4. Start capturing into `01-inbox/` and route weekly.
